# Frontend Mentor - Job listings with filtering

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this job listing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories
